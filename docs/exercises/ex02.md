# Exercise 02

## Part A

Write a class called `MyArrayListResizable` that extends `MyArrayList`.

Override the method `add(int index, T value)` in a way that, if the internal array is full,
then such array should be doubled in size before inserting the new element.

Write a test class called `MyArrayListResizableTest` that extends `MyListTestTemplate`,
where the instance of `MyArrayListResizable` is initialized with capacity of 1 
(i.e., the size for the internal array).
If your implementation of `MyArrayListResizable#add` is correct, then all tests should pass.


## Part B

Write a class called `MyRingArrayQueue` that implements `MyQueue`. 
Internally, it should be similar to the implementation of `MyQueueArray`, 
but with a fundamental performance improvement.
When by adding many elements the `tail` index reaches the end of the internal array,
**instead of** shifting elements to the left or copying over to a new larger array,
the `tail` should start back from `0`, unless of course `head==0`.
 
The idea is to reuse the empty spaces before `head` when `head>0`.
Note, when `head==0`, or when `tail` increases so much that it reaches `head`, then it would
mean that the array is completely full, and you need to copy over to a new internal array.

Write a `MyRingArrayQueueTest` that extends `MyQueueTestTemplate`. 
If your implementation is correct, all tests should pass.
Run the tests with code coverage enabled, and verify that all of the instructions in your
code are covered. If not, add new tests to `MyRingArrayQueueTest`.
 
 
 
## Part C
Using `MyLinkedList` as a starting point, create a new class called `MyBidirectionalLinkedList`.
Here, besides a `next` link, each node also has a `previous` link pointing to the previous node in
the list. All insert/delete operations need to properly handle and update such `previous` links.
When inserting/deleting/getting a node at position `index`, the algorithm should decide if rather start
the search from `head` using `next` links, or from `tail` using the `previous` links.
If `index <= size()/2`, it makes sense to start from `head`.
On the other hand, when `index > size()/2` it would be more efficient to start from `tail`.

Write a `MyBidirectionalLinkedListTest` that extends `MyListTestTemplate`. 
If your implementation is correct, all tests should pass.
Run the tests with code coverage enabled, and verify that all of the instructions in your
code are covered. If not, add new tests to `MyBidirectionalLinkedListTest`.  
 
 
 
## Part D

Study the source code of `MyLinkedList`, `MyStackLinkedList` and `MyQueueArray`.
Once you think you fully understand them, write their implementation
on paper (e.g., using a pen), without looking at the source code.
Once done, compare what you wrote with the actual implementations.
